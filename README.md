# Prepositional Phrase (PP) Idioms
Analyzing PP idioms in the Oxford Dictionary of English (ODE)

Each PP idiom consists of a multiple word expression (MWE), i.e., containing at least two words. Idioms were obtained from ODE entries either beginning or ending with a preposition from the Pattern Dictionary of English Prepositions (PDEP, <http://www.clres.com/db/TPPEditor.html>). This repository contains description of the analysis and files supporting the analysis.
